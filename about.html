      <p>
        I'm a 40 year old, female virgo. I love pet animals and plants. I joined Pursuit because I was laid off during the Covid pandemic and felt like I had nothing to offer the world. So this journey isn't just about making a ish load of money for me. I want to create/build something that will impact my community and maybe the world. Technology, and more specifically, the internet, is taking humanity into a whole new realm of future possibilities. I know I'm smart and I know I can do this. Pursuit is the beginning of my dive into the world of IT and I feel like it's the deep end. So I can only go up from here.

      <h3 class="hardest">Hardest Bug So Far</h3>
      <p>
        My hardest bug I ever came across was the Dinosaur Museum. I never want to visit that. 
      </p>
      <p>I came up with a totally sick solution though by doing ... it over and over and over again and pseudo-coded the hell out of it. </p>
